== Introduction

I've been using _Akka Typed_ for some time, and when I read the blog article
titled https://scala-lang.org/2019/12/18/road-to-scala-3.html[*"Scala 2 Roadmap Update - The Road to Scala 3"*]
on https://scala-lang.org[scala-lang.org], it reminded me of an idea I had when
I learned about _Union types_ in Dotty. More specifically, in the QA section of
the article under the _Migrating The Ecosystem_ section, specific instructions
were given about how to use Scala 2.13 binaries with Dotty source code. With
that, I had all I needed to start experimenting and to check that my idea was
sound. If so, the combination of Akka Typed with Dotty would enable an important
simplification of the way responses to messages are handled in _Akka Typed_
with Scala 2.

We'll start from a simple actor based application written in Scala 2 that uses
Akka 2.6.1, and we'll walk through 3 stages:

* Initial Scala 2/Akka 2.6.1 application
* Make the application run as-is on Dotty/Akka 2.6.1
* Take advantage of Dotty's Union types to simplify the code

=== A simple sample *_Akka 2.6_*/*_Scala 2_* application

The Scala 2/Akka 2.6.1 application consists of two actors, a `Pinger` and a
`PingPong` actor. Furthermore, there's a main program that will drive the
"pinging" process and signal the intent to terminate the program to the `Pinger`
actor after a preset number of pings. The following figure shows the main
components of the application and the messages flowing between them.

The fact that the application uses Akka Typed implies a number of things:

* Each actor has a strictly defined protocol, and any code that violates the
protocol will not compile.
* Unlike with Akka Classic, there's no implicit `sender()` that can be used to
respond to the sender of a message. With Akka Typed, we have to explicitly
send an appropriately typed `ActorRef` as part of a message so that the receiver
can use it to send a response.

Let's have a look at the protocol of the actors in our code:

[#img-PingPongProtocol]
.Protocol of `Pinger` and `PingPong` actors
image::../media/2020-02-12-using-dotty-union-types-with-akka-typed/PingPongProtocol-1.png[{in-between-width}]

As can be seen, the `Pinger` actor "understands" the `SendPing` and
`StopPingPong` messages while the `PingPong` actor understands the `Ping` message.
Combining the flow of messages in the application with the protocol definitions,
we see that we have to solve a problem: the `Pinger` actor needs to "understand"
the response message from the `PingPong` actor. Let's have a look at the code of
the protocol definition of both actors:

[source,scala,linenums]
----
object PingPong {

  sealed trait Command
  final case class Ping(replyTo: ActorRef[Response]) extends Command

  sealed trait Response
  case object Pong extends Response

  ...
}
----


[source,scala,linenums]
----
object Pinger {

  sealed trait Command
  case object SendPing extends Command
  case object StopPingPong extends Command

  ...
}
----

Obviously, there's something missing in the `Pinger` protocol definition: it has
to provide a way to understand the response from the `PingPong` actor. We
somehow need to extend the `Command` ADT to achieve this. In Scala 2 and Akka
2.6 this is achieved by using _message adapters_.

The following figure shows the updated protocol definition.

.Full protocol of `Pinger` and `PingPong` actors
image::../media/2020-02-12-using-dotty-union-types-with-akka-typed/PingPongProtocol-2.png[{in-between-width}]


The corresponding code looks as follows:

[source,scala,linenums]
----
object Pinger {

  sealed trait Command
  case object SendPing extends Command
  case object StopPingPong extends Command
  final case class WrappedPongResponse(pong: PingPong.Response)
    extends Command <1>

  def apply(pingPong: ActorRef[PingPong.Ping]): Behavior[Command] =
    Behaviors.setup { context =>
      val pongResponseMapper: ActorRef[PingPong.Response] =
        context.messageAdapter(response => WrappedPongResponse(response)) <2>

      Behaviors.receiveMessage {
        case StopPingPong =>
          context.log.info(s"End of ping-pong game")
          context.system.terminate()
          Behaviors.stopped
        case SendPing =>
          pingPong ! PingPong.Ping(replyTo = pongResponseMapper) <3>
          Behaviors.same
        case WrappedPongResponse(response) => <4>
          context.log.info(s"Hey: I just received a $response !!!")
          Behaviors.same
      }
  }
}
----

Let's explain this step-by-step: to start, we extend the `Command` ADT by adding
a new message that wraps the response (➊). Next, we use the `messageAdaptor`
method on the `ActorContext` to create a message adapter (➋). The type of the
latter is an `ActorRef[PingPong.Response]`. The message adapter is sent along to
the `PingPong` actor as a field in the `Ping` message (➌). Finally, we receive
the wrapped response (➍).

I think it's fair to state that this feels a bit boilerplate-ish and it
obfuscates the simple operation of receiving a message from another actor. We'll
see how Dotty can simplify this in the last section of this article.

The full code and instructions about how to run this specific step can be found
on https://github.com/lightbend/Pi-Akka-Cluster[this repository].

=== Running the application using *_Dotty_* instead of *_Scala 2_*

If we want to explore features unique to Dotty, which will become Scala 3 near
the end of 2020, with the application described in the previous paragraph, we
first need a way to run an application that uses libraries such as the Akka
2.16.1 library that was built with Scala 2.13. The Dotty folks describe how to
do exactly this in https://github.com/lampepfl/dotty-example-project#getting-your-project-to-compile-with-dotty[this paragraph]
of the main README of the https://github.com/lampepfl/dotty-example-project#getting-your-project-to-compile-with-dotty[Dotty Example Project].

We just need to make a few changes to our sbt build definition and load the
Dotty sbt plugin:

[source,scala,linenums]
----
$ cat build.sbt
val dottyVersion = "0.22.0-RC1"

lazy val root = project
  .in(file("."))
  .settings(
    name := "dotty-simple",
    version := "0.1.0",

    //scalaVersion := dottyLatestNightlyBuild.get,
    scalaVersion := dottyVersion,

    libraryDependencies += "ch.qos.logback" % "logback-classic" % "1.2.3",

    libraryDependencies ++= Seq(
       "com.typesafe.akka" %% "akka-actor-typed" % "2.6.1",
       "com.typesafe.akka" %% "akka-slf4j"       % "2.6.1",
       "org.scalatest"     %% "scalatest"        % "3.1.0" % "test",
    ).map(_.withDottyCompat(scalaVersion.value))   <1>
  )
----

[source,bash]
----
$ cat project/plugins.sbt
addSbtPlugin("ch.epfl.lamp" % "sbt-dotty" % "0.4.0")
----

So, not much going on here apart from applying
`withDottyCompat(scalaVersion.value))` to all cross-built libraries.

We're now ready for the final step in our experiment!

=== Using Dotty's Union types with Akka Typed

Dotty introduces two new types for us to use, _Intersection_ and _Union types_.
In a certain way, Intersection types are the counterpart of Union types. Let's
focus on the latter for this article.

From the Dotty reference documentation, we find the following definition for
Union types:

[#img-DottyUnionTypes]
image::../media/2020-02-12-using-dotty-union-types-with-akka-typed/Union types - definition.png[{in-between-width},align='center']

Interesting... and this brings us to my original idea about using Union types
together with Akka Typed: Union types give us the possibility to add the types
of the responses from other actors to an actor's `Command` ADT!

Here's how the `Pinger` actor's protocol looks now:

[#img-PingPongProtocolUnionTypes]
.Full protocol of `Pinger` and `PingPong` actors with Union types applied
image::../media/2020-02-12-using-dotty-union-types-with-akka-typed/PingPongProtocol-3.png[{in-between-width}]

The `Pinger` actor's implementation now looks as this:

[source,scala,linenums]
----
object Pinger {

sealed trait Command
  case object SendPing extends Command
  case object StopPingPong extends Command

  type CommandIncludingResponses = Command | PingPong.Response <1>

  def apply(pingPong: ActorRef[PingPong.Ping]):
                               Behavior[CommandIncludingResponses] = <2>
    Behaviors.setup { context =>

      Behaviors.receiveMessage {
        case StopPingPong =>
          context.log.info(s"End of ping-pong game")
          context.system.terminate()
          Behaviors.stopped
        case SendPing =>
          pingPong ! PingPong.Ping(replyTo = context.self)
          Behaviors.same
        case response : PingPong.Response => <3>
          context.log.info(s"Hey: I just received a $response !!!")
          Behaviors.same
      }
  }
}
----

We introduce a type alias for convenience (➊). It is a Union of the original
`Command` ADT and the type of the responses we want to be able process. We use
this Union type when we describe our `Behavior` (➋). With this in place, we can
perform a pattern match of `PingPong.Response` (➌) (which, in essence is a
`Pong` message).

And that's it! It doesn't get more concise!

=== Conclusions

In this article we have shown two important things about Dotty:

1. We can use existing Scala 2.13 libraries as-is in combination with Dotty
source code. This is a major convenience that can not be overestimated!
2. Dotty Union types can help to eliminate all the boilerplate that is needed
to handle responses from other actors in a given actor when using Scala 2.

Based on what I've read and experimented with, it's obvious that Dotty brings a
lot of features that enable writing more concise and clearer code. To name just
a few:

* Top level definitions
* Enums
* The completely overhauled contextual abstractions system (aka implicits in Scala 2)

Stay tuned for more on this.

This is all very exciting and I can't wait till the day Scala 3.0.0 hits Maven
Central!
