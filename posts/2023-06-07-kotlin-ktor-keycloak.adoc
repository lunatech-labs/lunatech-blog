At Lunatech we build many tools that facilitate internal processes like keeping track of employees' vacations, share internal events and workshops and even one just for the days Lunatech offers us lunch ;) So, it's only natural that we end up creating integrations between these applications.

The goal of this post is to explore the scenario where one application authenticates with another by using the Client Credentials Flow, in https://kotlinlang.org/[Kotlin], https://ktor.io/[Ktor] and https://www.keycloak.org/[Keycloak].
To achieve this, we are going to build a simple personal `luna-vacation-bot` that will inform you daily, via a https://slack.com/[Slack] message, whether the present day is a vacation day or not. For this, we will need to implement a dummy `luna-vacation-api` as well.

.Happy path diagram
image::diagram.png[Diagram, 600]

In the above diagram, we can see that the starting point of our system will be the `luna-vacation-bot`. It asks the `luna-vacation-api` whether the present day is a working day or not, but, for that request to be successful, first it needs to request a JWT token from Keycloak. Once it receives the token then it can send the request to the `luna-vacation-api` and, based on the response of that request, it can inform the user via a Slack message.
If `luna-vacation-bot` fails to receive a token from Keycloak or, if `luna-vacation-api` does not respond successfully, we can also send an error message via Slack, informing the user of the issue.

=== How to setup Keycloak?
First, we need a running instance of Keycloak. Recently, Lunatech deployed its own Keycloak instance for the Identity and Access Management of applications, but for this example I'm going to run a local instance of Keycloak, instead. We can easily run one using https://www.keycloak.org/getting-started/getting-started-docker[Docker].
The admin console can be found at http://localhost:8080[localhost:8080] with both username and password being `admin`.

==== Create a realm
On top of the default `master` realm let's create our own realm called `lunarealm`.

.Creating a new Realm
image::keycloak-create-realm.png[Create Realm, 600]

==== Create a client
Let's create the client `luna-vacation-bot` which is the one that is going to need to authenticate with the `luna-vacation-api` and use the API:

.Creating a new client
image::keycloak-new-client-1.png[Create client, 600]

After setting the client id, name and description, click Next for the capability config section and turn `Client authentication` and `Service accounts roles` **on** and all the other authentication flows **off**. The client is now configured for the Client Credentials Flow in OAuth2. Click Next again and Save.

.Configuring the client capability
image::keycloak-new-client-2.png[Create client, 600]

In order to increase our client security, we are also creating a new `Client Scope` called `luna-vacation-bot-scope` using the default settings:

.Creating a new Client Scope
image::keycloak-create-client-scope-1.png[Create client, 600]

Once you save the new scope, a couple of configuration tabs will show up: `Mappers` and `Scope`. Go to `Mappers` and choose `Configure a new mapper` and then choose `Audience`:

.Creating a new Client Scope Mapper
image::keycloak-create-client-scope-2.png[Create client, 600]

Give it a name and then set `luna-vacation-bot` in `Included Client Audience` and also add it to the tokens:

.Configuring the new Client Scope Mapper
image::keycloak-create-client-scope-3.png[Create client, 600]

Go back to the details of the `luna-vacation-bot` client, to `Client scopes`, `Add client scope` and choose the new `luna-vacation-bot-scope` Default scope and add it:

.Adding the new client scope to the client
image::keycloak-add-client-scope.png[Create client, 600]

One more client scope needs a final configuration. Go to the dedicated client scope called `luna-vacation-bot-dedicated` and click on it.
In `Mappers` choose `Add mapper` > `From predefined mappers` and then add `audience resolve`:

.Adding a predefined mapper to the client scope
image::keycloak-dedicaded-scope.png[Create client, 600]

Finally, still inside the same `luna-vacation-bot-dedicated` scope, go to the `Scope` tag and set `Full scope allowed` off.

.Modifying the client scope settings
image::keycloak-dedicated-scope-full-scope.png[Create client, 400]

We are all set to start using JWT tokens!

==== Test the creation of a token

To test if `luna-vacation-bot` can successfully get a JWT token we also need the client secret.
The secret can be found in the `Credentials` tab:

.Where to find the client's secret
image::keycloak-client-secret.png[Client secret, 600]

Let's use curl to generate the token:

[source,commandline]
----
curl -X post 'http://localhost:8080/realms/lunarealm/protocol/openid-connect/token' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
--data-urlencode 'grant_type=client_credentials' \
--data-urlencode 'client_id=luna-vacation-bot' \
--data-urlencode 'client_secret=<replace-by-secret>'
----

The token will look something like:

[source,json]
----
{"access_token":"eyJhbG...75Eg","expires_in":300,"refresh_expires_in":0,"token_type":"Bearer","not-before-policy":0,"scope":"email luna-vacation-bot_scope profile"}
----

==== Verify the token in jwt.io
In https://jwt.io/[jwt.io] you can inspect the contents of a token. Copy the `access_token` string and paste it in the `Encoded` box. I'm not going into details about the format and content of the token, you can read a nice https://jwt.io/introduction[introduction] about it in jwt.io site as well.

.Some of the token payload details
image::keycloak-token.png[Client secret, 400]

We can confirm that the `issuer` (iss) of the token is `lunarealm` and that the `audience` (aud) and the `authorized party` (azp) are `luna-vacation-bot`.

=== Create the luna-vacation-api
We are using https://kotlinlang.org/[Kotlin] and https://ktor.io/[Ktor] to build the API. Following the recent tendency, Ktor provides a project scaffolding https://start.ktor.io/[generator] that adds some sample code and allows adding plugins. Remember to add the Authentication JWT plugin.

.Generating the luna-vacation-api project
image::ktor-project-generator.png[Client secret, 500]

Download and open the project in your IDE of choice. The test dependencies and test folder can be removed.
Following the documentation in https://ktor.io/docs/jwt.html[ktor.io] on how to handle JSON web tokens let's add the following dependencies in `build.gradle.kts`:

[source,kotlin]
----
implementation "io.ktor:ktor-server-auth-jwt:2.3.0"
implementation "io.ktor:ktor-server-auth-jwt-jvm:2.3.0"
----

We can now start adding some code. Let's start by our API endpoint `onvacation` that determines that odd day numbers are days off and even days are working days.

[source,kotlin]
----
fun Application.configureRouting() {
    routing {
        authenticate("auth-jwt") {
            get("/onvacation") {
                val today = LocalDate.now()
                if (today.dayOfMonth % 2 == 0) {
                    call.respondText("Today you have a day off")
                } else {
                    call.respondText("Today you have to work")
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
----

You can notice that the endpoint already includes an authentication precondition called `auth-jwt`.
This detail is very important, as without it the endpoint would be available to non-authenticated parties.

In `fun Application.module()` we need to set up how this authentication takes places.
In our case we can validate the token realm, issuer, audience and limit access to `luna-vacation-bot` for authorized parties only. The token signature also needs to be validated and for that we need to provide the url to the JSON Web Keys available in the `protocol/openid-connect/certs` endpoint.

[source,kotlin]
----
install(Authentication) {
        jwt("auth-jwt") {
            realm = "lunarealm"
            verifier(
                UrlJwkProvider(URL("http://localhost:8080/realms/lunarealm/protocol/openid-connect/certs")),
                "http://localhost:8080/realms/lunarealm",
            ) {
                withAudience("luna-vacation-bot")
                withClaim("azp", "luna-vacation-bot")
            }
            challenge { _, _ ->
                call.respond(HttpStatusCode.Unauthorized, "Token is not valid or has expired")
            }
            validate { credential ->
                validateCredential(credential, issuer)
            }
        }
    }
----
If the authentication fails it returns the `challenge`, in this case a _401 Unauthorized_ with an error message.

The `validateCredentials` function is simply validating that the token has not expired, after all other validations have passed.

[source,kotlin]
----
fun validateCredential(credential: JWTCredential, issuer: String): JWTPrincipal? {
    if (credential.expiresAt?.after(Date()) == true
    ) {
        return JWTPrincipal(credential.payload)
    }

    return null
}
----

==== Test the API
We can test the api using `curl`.
If we secured the endpoint properly, calling the `onvacation` endpoint without a token should return an error.

[source,commandline]
----
$ curl localhost:4040/onvacation
Token is not valid or has expired
----

As explained in the initial diagram, we need to request a token from Keycloak and send it together with the request. We can use the credentials we have for `luna-vacation-bot`:

[source,commandline]
----
curl -X post 'http://localhost:8080/realms/lunarealm/protocol/openid-connect/token' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
--data-urlencode 'grant_type=client_credentials' \
--data-urlencode 'client_id=luna-vacation-bot' \
--data-urlencode 'client_secret=<replace-by-secret>'
----

We grab the `access_token` part of the response and add it to the request header as a Bearer token:

[source,commandline]
----
$ curl 'localhost:4040/onvacation' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJ...QBhNiX6w'
----

And now we get a result:

[source,commandline]
----
Today you have to work
----


=== Create the luna-vacation-bot

To create the `luna-vacation-bot` project we are going to use https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/[Intellij] and create a new Kotlin application, with https://gradle.org/[Gradle] and JDK 17 (you can use JDK 8 or higher). After creating the project we can remove the test folder and the test dependencies.

==== Integrate with luna-vacation-api

In order to query the `luna-vacation-api` we need an http client. We are going to use the https://ktor.io/docs/create-client.html[ktor-client] library by adding the necessary dependencies to `build.gradle.kts`:

[source,kotlin]
----
implementation("io.ktor:ktor-client-core:2.3.1")
implementation("io.ktor:ktor-client-cio:2.3.1")
implementation("io.ktor:ktor-client-serialization:2.3.1")
implementation("io.ktor:ktor-client-content-negotiation:2.3.1")
implementation("io.ktor:ktor-serialization-kotlinx-json:2.3.1")
----

When creating the http client we need to add the json `ContentNegotiation` and the flag `ignoreUnknownKeys` for the response deserialization,
to ignore the json fields that we are not interested in.

[source,kotlin]
----
    val client = HttpClient(CIO) {
        install(ContentNegotiation) {
            json(
                Json {
                    ignoreUnknownKeys = true
                },
            )
        }
    }
----

Now that the http client is properly setup we will start by retrieving a JWT token from Keycloak:

[source,kotlin]
----
@Serializable
data class BotToken(val access_token: String)

val token = client.submitForm(
        url = "http://localhost:8080/realms/lunarealm/protocol/openid-connect/token",
        formParameters = parameters {
            append("grant_type", "client_credentials")
            append("client_id", "luna-vacation-bot")
            append("client_secret", "<replace by client_secret>")
        },
    ).body<BotToken>().access_token
----

and then we can finally call the `luna-vacation-api`:

[source,kotlin]
----
val response = client.get("http://localhost:5050/imionvacation") {
        bearerAuth(token)
    }.bodyAsText()
----

And what do we do with the `response` now? We send it to https://slack.com/[Slack] using a https://slack.com/apps[Slack App]. So let's do that next.


=== Create a Slack app
You can create your own workspace at https://slack.com/[slack.com]. Once you have it, you can create a new https://api.slack.com/apps[App]. Choose `Create New App` and then `From scratch`:

.Creating a new Slack App
image::slack-create-app-1.png[Diagram, 400]

I named the app `ImIOnVacation` and added it to my personal workspace:

.Configuring the Slack App workspace
image::slack-create-app-2.png[Diagram, 400]

To finalize the App creation you need to set some permissions:

.Configuring the Slack App permissions
image::slack-app-permissions.png[Diagram, 400]

In `Basic Information` you can personalize the appearance off the app, but for now let's jump to `OAuth & Permission` and, from there, scroll down to the `Scopes` section. In `User Token Scopes` add the scopes `chat:write`:

.Configuring the User Token Scopes
image::slack-app-scopes.png[Diagram, 400]

Then scroll up and click `Install to Workspace`. That will take us to a permissions screen: click `Allow`. We can see that a `User OAuth Token` was created as well.

.Slack App User OAuth token
image::slack-user-oauth-token.png[Diagram, 300]

We will need this `User OAuth Token` to be able to send messages to Slack via this App.

=== Put it all together

We can now send that `luna-vacation-api` response to a Slack channel. The channel I'll use is the chat with myself.
On Slack, channel IDs can be seen on the channel or chat details, at the very bottom.

For the communication with Slack we will use Slack's https://slack.dev/java-slack-sdk/guides/getting-started-with-bolt[Bolt SDK],
starting by adding the necessary dependencies:

[source,kotlin]
----
implementation("com.slack.api:bolt:1.29.2")
implementation("com.slack.api:bolt-servlet:1.29.2")
implementation("com.slack.api:bolt-jetty:1.29.2")
implementation("org.slf4j:slf4j-simple:1.7.36")
----

Now let's https://slack.dev/java-slack-sdk/guides/getting-started-with-bolt[compose our message].
The function `getOnVacation` is wrapping the `luna-vacation-api` request.

[source,kotlin]
----
val text = getOnVacation(client)
val response = slack.methods("xoxp-...").chatPostMessage { req: ChatPostMessageRequestBuilder ->
    req
        .channel("<replace by my channel>")
        .text(text)
}
----

Make sure `luna-vacation-api` is still running and now let's run `luna-vacation-bot`. If we check Slack we should see a message:

.Slack message
image::slack-message.png[Diagram, 200]

The complete source code for the https://github.com/leo-bogastry/luna-vacation-api[luna-vacation-api] and https://github.com/leo-bogastry/luna-vacation-bot[luna-vacation-bot] are available on GitHub.

=== Next steps

We can transform this kind of application integration in a real automation by running it periodically.
A cron job allows to achieve this goal and the http://www.quartz-scheduler.org/documentation/quartz-2.3.0/quick-start.html[quartz-scheduler] library integrates well with Kotlin.
The cron job can be configured as often was one wishes like several time a day or once a month, for example.

In this blog post we used a dummy API. For a real use case we could replace it with an API that provides data reports, for example.
Imagine yourself surprising your manager with some automated reports delivered to their Slack or email address!
