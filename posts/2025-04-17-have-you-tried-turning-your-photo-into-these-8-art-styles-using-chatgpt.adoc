== Have You Tried Turning Your Photo Into These 8 Art Styles Using ChatGPT?

If you're still using ChatGPT just for debugging or boilerplate, you're missing the fun stuff. The image tools? Totally underrated.

With ChatGPT Plus and DALL·E, you can generate completely different art styles from a single photo—LEGO, anime, Pixar, pixel art, you name it. Just upload a photo and type a prompt. That’s it.

[NOTE]
====
DALL·E doesn’t apply a filter—it reimagines your image. When you upload a photo and prompt a style, ChatGPT passes that information to DALL·E, which generates a brand-new image based on the original's composition, pose, and vibe.

Here’s a quick rundown of 8 styles worth trying—whether you’re just killing time between builds or exploring what else AI can do beyond code.

=== 1. *LEGO Style*  
You, but made of bricks. Blocky face, glossy plastic, and that classic minifig expression.
