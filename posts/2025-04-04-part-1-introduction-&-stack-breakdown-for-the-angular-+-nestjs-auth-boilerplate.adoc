Welcome to the first post in this series on building a full-stack
authentication boilerplate with *Angular*, *NestJS*, and *PostgreSQL*.

If you’re a backend developer comfortable with APIs, databases, and
business logic—but frontend frameworks feel like foreign territory—this
series is for you. We’ll walk through the full stack, showing you how to
build real authentication flows while picking up modern Angular features
along the way.

By the end, you’ll have a production-ready authentication boilerplate
you can reuse in your own projects—or hand off confidently to frontend
collaborators.

==== Why Angular + NestJS?

We’re using *Angular* on the frontend and *NestJS* on the backend. Both
are built in *TypeScript*, so you get a unified development experience
without switching mental models.

Here’s why this stack works well together:

* *Angular* is opinionated, scalable, and modular—perfect for building
real apps, not just prototypes. Angular 19 introduces useful features
like Signals and new control flow syntax that cut boilerplate and
improve performance.
* *NestJS* is a structured backend framework with decorators, guards,
and strong support for things like JWTs and PostgreSQL—ideal for secure
authentication systems.
* *PostgreSQL* is a reliable, battle-tested relational database with
great tooling and support for user/session management.

Together, this stack gives you a clean, testable, and scalable
foundation—without gluing together a bunch of libraries yourself.

==== What You’ll Build

Over this series, you’ll create a modular, full-stack authentication
boilerplate with:

* A NestJS backend featuring JWT login and registration
* A styled Angular frontend with auth forms and route guards
* Token management, global error handling, and frontend state control
* CI/CD pipelines, testing setup, and a containerized dev environment

This isn’t a toy app—it’s a starting point for real projects.

==== What’s New in Angular 19

Angular 19 introduces major improvements that simplify frontend
development and reduce complexity:

* *Signals* – A new reactive state primitive. Think of it like
`+useState+`, but built into Angular. Great for managing form state and
authentication status.
* *Control Flow Syntax* – `+@if+`, `+@for+`, and `+@switch+` clean up
your templates and reduce the need for verbose structural directives.
* *Defer Blocks* – Lazily load components based on app state, perfect
for gating authenticated vs. public views.
* *Improved Change Detection* – Smarter re-rendering out of the box for
better performance.

We’ll use these features where they make sense—especially in the login
and registration flows—so you learn by doing.

==== Who This Is For

This series is for backend developers who want to:

* Understand modern Angular concepts without getting lost in frontend
jargon
* Build secure, token-based authentication flows using best practices
* Deploy real full-stack apps with confidence

You don’t need Angular experience. If you know TypeScript, you’ll feel
at home.

==== Tools You’ll Need

===== Required

* *Node.js* – Backend + Angular CLI
* *NestJS CLI* – Backend scaffolding
* *Angular CLI* – Frontend scaffolding
* *PostgreSQL* – Local dev database
* *Git* – Version control

===== Optional (but helpful)

* *Postman* – For testing APIs
* *pgAdmin* – For inspecting the database
* *VS Code* – With TypeScript extensions

==== Getting Set Up

. *Install Node.js* +
https://nodejs.org
+
[source,bash]
----
node -v
npm -v
----
. *Install Angular and NestJS CLIs*
+
[source,bash]
----
npm install -g @angular/cli @nestjs/cli
----
. *Install PostgreSQL* +
https://www.postgresql.org/download
+
[source,sql]
----
CREATE DATABASE auth_boilerplate;
----
. *Initialize Git Repo*
+
[source,bash]
----
git init
----

==== Coming Up Next (Part 2)

In Part 2, we’ll scaffold the NestJS backend, hook it up to PostgreSQL
with TypeORM, and implement JWT-based login and registration logic you
can actually ship.

==== Final Thoughts

This series is about building something real—not another tutorial app
you toss out after reading. Whether it’s for a SaaS product, side
project, or production tool, having a solid authentication foundation
makes every other feature easier to build.
