Welcome to the first part in this series on building a full-stack
authentication boilerplate with *Angular*, *NestJS*, and *PostgreSQL*.

If you’re a backend developer comfortable with APIs, databases, and business
logic—but frontend frameworks feel like foreign territory—this series is for
you.
We’ll walk through the full stack, showing you how to build real
authentication flows while picking up modern Angular features along the way.

By the end, you’ll have a production-ready authentication boilerplate you
can reuse in your own projects—or hand off confidently to frontend
collaborators.

=== Why Angular + NestJS?

We’re using *Angular* on the frontend and *NestJS* on the backend.
Both are built in *TypeScript*, so you get a unified development experience
without switching mental models.

Here’s why this stack works well together:

* *Angular* is opinionated, scalable, and modular—perfect for building real
apps, not just prototypes.
Angular 19 introduces useful features like Signals and new control flow
syntax that cut boilerplate and improve performance.
* *NestJS* is a structured backend framework with decorators, guards, and
strong support for things like JWTs and PostgreSQL—ideal for secure
authentication systems.
* *PostgreSQL* is a reliable, battle-tested relational database with great
tooling and support for user/session management.

Together, this stack gives you a clean, testable, and scalable
foundation—without gluing together a bunch of libraries yourself.

=== What You’ll Build

Over this series, you’ll create a modular, full-stack authentication
boilerplate with:

* A NestJS backend featuring JWT login and registration
* A styled Angular frontend with auth forms and route guards
* Token management, global error handling, and frontend state control
* CI/CD pipelines, testing setup, and a containerized dev environment

This isn’t a toy app—it’s a starting point for real projects.

=== What’s New in Angular 19

Angular 19 introduces major improvements that simplify frontend development
and reduce complexity:

* *Signals* – A new reactive state primitive.
Think of it like `+useState+`, but built into Angular.
Great for managing form state and authentication status.
* *Control Flow Syntax* – `+@if+`, `+@for+`, and `+@switch+` clean up your
templates and reduce the need for verbose structural directives.
* *Defer Blocks* – Lazily load components based on app state, perfect for
gating authenticated vs. public views.
* *Improved Change Detection* – Smarter re-rendering out of the box for
better performance.

We’ll use these features where they make sense—especially in the login and
registration flows—so you learn by doing.

=== Who This Is For

This series is for backend developers who want to:

* Understand modern Angular concepts without getting lost in frontend jargon
* Build secure, token-based authentication flows using best practices
* Deploy real full-stack apps with confidence

You don’t need Angular experience.
If you know TypeScript, you’ll feel at home.

=== Tools You’ll Need

==== Required

* *Node.js* – Backend + Angular CLI
* *NestJS CLI* – Backend scaffolding
* *Angular CLI* – Frontend scaffolding
* *PostgreSQL* – Local dev database
* *Git* – Version control

==== Optional (but helpful)

* *Postman* – For testing APIs
* *pgAdmin* – For inspecting the database
* *VS Code* – With TypeScript extensions

=== Getting Set Up

. *Install Node.js* +
https://nodejs.org
+
[source,bash]
----
node -v
npm -v
----
. *Install Angular and NestJS CLIs*
+
[source,bash]
----
npm install -g @angular/cli @nestjs/cli
----
. *Install PostgreSQL* +
https://www.postgresql.org/download
+
[source,sql]
----
CREATE DATABASE auth_boilerplate;
----
. *Initialize Git Repo*
+
[source,bash]
----
git init
----

=== Coming Up Next (Part 2)

In Part 2, we’ll scaffold the NestJS backend, hook it up to PostgreSQL with
TypeORM, and implement JWT-based login and registration logic you can
actually ship.

=== Final Thoughts

This series is about building something real—not another tutorial app you
toss out after reading.
Whether it’s for a SaaS product, side project, or production tool, having a
solid authentication foundation makes every other feature easier to build.
