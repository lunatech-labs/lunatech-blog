After 2 years of waiting (the celebration of our 30 years of LT fell in between ðŸ˜Š), we held our Lunatech conference this year on the 4th of October in our wonderful office in Rotterdam on the 22nd and 23rd floor. We welcomed our colleagues from France, who arrived the evening before when we entertained them with food, wine and music; we had speakers from various countries and expertise, clients, guests and ex-employees from Lunatech.

### The Start of the Day

Our day started with welcoming everyone and handing out our new Lunatech t-shirts to all the attending employees as well as the t-shirts for our speakers and our conference bracelets and keychain goodies. Our CEO _Nicolas Leroux_ opened the conference with some welcome words and then we kicked off the talks with two speakers from Lunatech (_Willem Jan Glerum_, who talked about "SSO made easy with Quarkus OIDC" and _Gustavo De Micheli_, who talked about "Typeclass Derivation on Scala 3"), our experts in acquisition _Erwin Merkx_ & _Paul Denis_ and a 2,5-hour presentation about "AI/ML in Software Development" from our employees _Radek Kargul_ and _Ji Darwish_. 

After that, we continued with _Julien Enoch_, who talked about "SDV/Zenoh", _Nicolas Thuilliez_ who talked about "Lean Management" and _Konstantin Kolmar_ with his presentation about "Building desktop apps in Kotlin". A special segment featured a presentation on our Lunatech push-up challenge, with _Giovanni Barbaro_ and _Nicolas Leroux_, followed by _Evgenii Frank_â€™s session on "How to Do Effective Push-ups".

### Lunch Break and Refueling

After we all refuelled with food, it was _Nicolas Leroux_â€™s turn to talk about "Scaling Beyond Code: Balancing Technical and Human Factors for Project Success" and _Michael Strauss_'s question about "How to take a good picture in any situation".

After a short break with coffee and cake, _Thomas Segismont_ talked about "Vert.x 5 news and roadmap" and _StÃ©phane Ã‰pardaud_ "Under the hood: tricks, hacks and techniques that make Quarkus so enjoyable and fast". Our colleague _Michael Strauss_ had another presentation, this time about "How not to benchmark" and _Erik Bakker_ talked about "the hot topic Infosec At Lunatech: Doctrine, policy and toolings". Besides all these talks, _Sylke Sauerwald_ also provided a workshop on Tai Chi.

### Bringing the Day to a Close

We then reached the end of the conference, our CEO _Nicolas Leroux_ said some closing words and our caterer started serving dinner. With excellent food and wine, we started the evening and ended the day with some dancing to music from our in-house DJs _Tanguy Serrand_ and _Titouan Guiochet_. 

All in all, it was a fabulous day, ending in a great night and everyone left having learnt something new, has met interesting people and hopefully will join us at our next conference again.
