= A practical series for backend developers building secure full-stack apps

For backend developers who want to ship full-stack projects—without wrestling with frontend complexity.

We’re building a **full-stack authentication boilerplate**—a reusable, modular codebase that gives you login, registration, route protection, token handling, and database integration out of the box. Clone it, customize it, and start building faster.

==== 🧱 Why This Stack?

We chose **Angular 19** and **NestJS** for a reason:

- **TypeScript end-to-end**: Write frontend and backend in the same language with consistent tooling.
- **Angular 19** introduces Signals and control flow syntax (`@if`, `@for`), simplifying state and UI logic.
- **NestJS** is structured, modular, and test-friendly—ideal for developers coming from Spring or .NET.
- **PostgreSQL** + **TypeORM** provide a robust relational layer with strong typing and migrations.

You *could* build this with React, Express, or MongoDB. But we picked this stack for its structure and scalability—great for teams or solo developers who want a solid foundation, not just flexibility.

==== 🗺️ What’s in the Series?

Here’s the roadmap 👇

Each post builds on the last, walking you through:

- ✅ JWT login & registration
- ✅ Angular route guards & auth state
- ✅ NestJS modules, guards, and services
- ✅ PostgreSQL setup with TypeORM
- ✅ CI/CD, E2E tests with Playwright, and Docker deployment

You don’t need prior Angular or NestJS experience—just TypeScript and backend fundamentals.

==== 🧭 Why This Series Exists

You don’t need another to-do app.

You need a **working authentication foundation**—something you can reuse, extend, and deploy. That’s what this series delivers, while helping you build real frontend + backend skills along the way.

Let’s build something you can actually ship.
