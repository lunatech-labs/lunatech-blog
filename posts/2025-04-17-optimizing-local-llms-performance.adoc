Local large language models (LLMs) are becoming more capable and accessible than ever — but to truly unlock their power, you need to know how to optimize them.
Whether you're running AI on an M-series MacBook or a 2019 Intel machine, there are tricks to get better speed, quality, and control.

In the final session of our GenAI series (after covering Local Dev, RAG, and Agents), we explored the real-world performance tuning of local LLMs.
Here's what we covered 👇

== 1. Running LLMs on Your Laptop

=== Apple Silicon vs Intel Macs

[cols="3,2,2",options="header"]
|===
| Feature | Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3/M4) | Intel Mac (e.g. 2019 MBP)

| CPU & GPU
| Unified on one chip (SoC)
| Separate chips for CPU and GPU

| Memory
| Shared Unified Memory Architecture
| RAM for CPU, VRAM for GPU

| Model performance
| Fast, efficient, great for LLMs
| Slower, GPU mostly unused
|===

[NOTE]
====
M-series chips shine for local AI workloads thanks to unified memory.

Intel Macs can still work well but rely entirely on CPUs and may struggle with larger models.
====

=== What Can You Run?

Models are measured by *parameters*, typically in billions (e.g., 3B, 7B, 13B).
More parameters = more "intelligence" — but also more memory use.

Use quantization (more below!) to fit larger models, even on machines with 8–16 GB RAM.

== 2. Quantization: Making LLMs Lighter

=== What is Quantization?

Quantization reduces the *precision of the numbers* in a model — trading a little accuracy for huge gains in size and speed.

[cols="1,2,2",options="header"]
|===
| Format | Description | Typical Use
| FP32 | Full precision | Training
| FP16 | Half precision | Deployment
| INT8 | Quantized | Light inference (some loss)
| INT4 | Heavily quantized | Fast local inference
| INT2–3 | Experimental | Ultra-lightweight, niche
|===

[example]
====
LLaMA2-70B goes from *138GB (FP16)* to *42GB (INT4)* — a huge saving!
====

=== What is GGUF?

`GGUF` stands for *GPT-Generated Unified Format*.
It’s a modern, standardized file format designed for running **quantized large language models (LLMs) locally**.

==== Why GGUF?

GGUF makes loading and using models in tools like `llama.cpp`, `Ollama`, or `LM Studio`.

[cols="1,3",options="header"]
|===
| Feature | Benefit

| 🧳 Compact | Stores quantized models in a smaller, efficient format
| 🧠 Self-contained | Includes weights, tokenizer, metadata, and vocab in one file
| ⚡ Fast | Optimized for quick loading and inference
| 🔧 Flexible | Supports various quantization formats like `Q4_K_M`, `Q5_K_S`, etc.
|===

==== Tools that Support GGUF

* `llama.cpp` – Core backend for CPU/GPU inference
* `Ollama` – CLI + API for local models
* `LM Studio` – Desktop GUI for Mac/Windows/Linux
* `text-generation-webui` – Powerful browser-based frontend

==== Example GGUF Model Filename

[source,text]
----
mistral-7b-instruct-v0.1.Q4_K_M.gguf
----

[cols="1,3",options="header"]
|===
| Part | Description

| `mistral-7b-instruct` | Model type and size
| `v0.1` | Model version
| `Q4_K_M` | Quantization type (4-bit, medium group)
| `.gguf` | File format extension
|===

Think of a `.gguf` file as an *AI-in-a-box* — it includes everything the model needs to run locally, compressed and ready to go.

=== K-Quant Types (for GGUF Models)

When downloading quantized models (especially in GGUF format), you'll often see suffixes like `Q4_K_S`, `Q5_K_M`, or `Q6_K_L`.
These aren't just random labels — they define **how the quantization is applied**, and they directly affect **model quality vs. performance**.

The `K` in these names refers to the **quantization group size and method**, which influences:

* how much precision is preserved;
* how fast the model can run;
* how much RAM is required.

[cols="1,3",options="header"]
|===
| Suffix | Description

| `K_S` | **Small group quantization**
Fastest and most memory-efficient. It compresses more aggressively, which means it's ideal when you're on a tight memory budget or running on weaker hardware — but output quality might noticeably degrade on complex tasks.

| `K_M` | **Medium group quantization**
A great balance of speed, memory use, and output quality. It's the "safe middle ground" for most users running 4–7B models locally. If you're unsure where to start, this is a solid default.

| `K_L` | **Large group quantization**
More conservative compression — keeps more precision, giving higher-quality outputs. Slower and uses more RAM, but closer to non-quantized behavior. Ideal for tasks requiring accurate and nuanced responses.
|===

The difference isn't *just* in speed — it's also in how much subtle detail the model retains in its responses.

“Think of `K_S`, `K_M`, and `K_L` as image compression presets:
*Small* is low-res JPEG, *Medium* is standard HD, *Large* is almost RAW quality.”

=== What is Quantization used for?

Quantization is a trade-off between size, speed, and accuracy.
For some perspective, here’s a rough guide on how quantization is used in the LLM world:

[cols="1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Task | Quantization
| Model training | FP32 (that's why it is so expensive to train models, to get that knowledge accurate)
| For deployment | Usually FP16 (for speed)
| Local models | Unused INT4 (for speed and accuracy)
|===

=== Why Not Just Use a Smaller Model?

* Models under 3B can run easily — but often lack reasoning or language nuance.
* Quantization gives you *the best of both worlds*: keep a 7B+ model’s brain but shrink the size.

=== Quantized Models In Action (Example)

In this example, we consider https://ollama.com/library/qwen2.5/tags[qwen2.5], a 14B model with quantized versions available in `Ollama`.
We will focus on different quantization levels of the 14B model.

Let's have a look at how different models deal with the following prompt:

[source,text]
----
Explain recursion to a 10-year-old in one paragraph.
----

To run the models, execute one of the following prompts, starting with Q4_0:

[source,shell]
----
ollama run qwen2.5:14b-instruct-q4_0
ollama run qwen2.5:14b-instruct-q8_0
ollama run qwen2.5:14b-instruct-q2_K
ollama run qwen2.5:14b-instruct-fp16
----

You may have noticed there is not much difference in quality between the Q4_0 and Q8_0 models, but the Q2_K model is much faster and smaller.
Perfect for showing the quality/speed trade-off in action, and how to adjust for your needs.
This does not necessarily mean that the behavior is the same for other prompts or tasks.
You have to try this for yourself and see what works best for you on your machine.

== 3. Tuning Parameters in Ollama

Using *Ollama*?
You can change some parameter settings of the local models based on your preference, for example, a more deterministic response, or a more creative one.

Let us consider the `llama3` model, we can run it with the following command:

[source,shell]
----
ollama run llama3
----

You can set these parameters after the model is loaded:

----
/set parameter <parameter> <value>
----

So, for example, to set `temperature` to 1.0:

----
/set parameter temperature 1.0
----

And then we set `top_p` to 0.9:

----
/set parameter top_p 0.9
----

In the example above, we set the `temperature` to 1.0, a more creative response, and `top_p` to 0.9, a more deterministic response.
Parameter `temperature` adds randomness.
The lower the value, the more focused and deterministic the model response.
The higher the value, the more creative and varied the response.
Parameter `top_p` picks from the smallest possible set of words whose cumulative probability adds up to `p`.
It controls diversity — higher values mean more diverse and creative responses, and lower values make responses more focused.

Here are some more common parameters you can tune:

[cols="1,2,1",options="header"]
|===
| Param | What it Does | Typical Values

| num_ctx | Context size (how much it remembers) | 2048–4096
| top_k | Limits top options for output | 40–100
| top_p | Controls diversity | 0.8–0.95
| temperature | Controls creativity | 0.6–0.8 (chat), 0.3–0.6 (code)
| repeat_penalty | Avoids repeating phrases | 1.1–1.3
| threads | Number of CPU threads (config only) | Match to physical cores
