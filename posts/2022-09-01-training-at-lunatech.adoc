After having delivered the Lightbend Akka Streams with Scala Professional training to
colleagues at the Lunatech France office in Chessy, I thought it was a good time as any
do a quick update on training at Lunatech.

We consider training to be a crucial element in bringing and keeping
consultants up-to-date on the continuously evolving technology space in our industry sector.

We leverage existing trainings, such as the Scala and Akka courses from Lightbend and
we are also licensing the excellent https://www.fp-tower.com/courses/foundations[Foundations of Functional Programming in Scala] training course developed by Julien Truffaut at
https://www.fp-tower.com[FP-Tower]. On top of that, we continue to develop and maintain
courses ourselves on topics where as specific need exists. Here are a few examples of the latter

- https://github.com/lunatech-labs/lunatech-scala-2-to-scala3-course[Moving from Scala 2 to Scala 3]
- https://github.com/lunatech-labs/lunatech-akka-streams-with-scala[Lunatech Akka Streams with Scala Expert]
- https://github.com/lunatech-labs/kubernetes-troubleshooting-scenarios[Troubleshooting Kubernetes workshop]
- https://github.com/eloots/Pi-Akka-Cluster[Understanding Akka Cluster with Raspberry Pi]

Of course, there are the Lightbend courses that we can offer:

- https://academy.lightbend.com/courses/course-v1:lightbend+Scala-Language-Professional+Instructor-Led/about[Lightbend Scala Language Professional]
- https://academy.lightbend.com/courses/course-v1:lightbend+Scala-Language-Expert+Instructor-Led/about[Lightbend Scala Language Expert]
- https://academy.lightbend.com/courses/course-v1:lightbend+LTS-P+v1/about[Lightbend Akka Streams with Scala Professional]
- https://academy.lightbend.com/courses/course-v1:lightbend+Reactive-Architecture-Professional+Instructor-Led/about[Lightbend Reactive Architecture Professional]

If you're reading this post as a non-Lunatech person, you may be asking yourself, +
_"Sounds interesting, how does this help me?"_

Well, the good news is that we're opening these courses to external participants!
