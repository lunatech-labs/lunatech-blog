**Abstract:** 
Discover how data seamlessly moves between components and templates in Angular through interpolation, property binding, event binding, and two-way binding, with a glimpse at Angular 20's innovative template features like template literals.

== Understanding Data Binding in Angular

=== Introduction to Data Binding

Data binding in Angular is a powerful tool that establishes a communication pathway between components and their templates. Various data binding techniques—interpolation, property binding, event binding, and two-way binding—are pivotal for creating dynamic and engaging web applications.

=== Interpolation in Angular

Interpolation simplifies data display from the component class to the template. By enclosing component properties within double curly braces {{}}, we effortlessly integrate dynamic data like user names or product details into the HTML template.

[source,html]
----
<div>
   <h1>Welcome, {{ username }}</h1>
</div>
----

=== Property Binding

Property binding empowers us to assign a component class value to an element property. Using square brackets [], we can dynamically alter the appearance or behavior of HTML elements based on component data.

[source,html]
----
<button [disabled]="isDisabled">Click Me</button>
----

=== Event Binding

Event binding enables us to detect and respond to user interactions such as clicks or keypresses. By enclosing event names in parentheses (), we can invoke functions defined in the component class when the specified event occurs.

[source,html]
----
<button (click)="handleClick()">Click Me</button>
----

=== Two-Way Binding

Two-way binding amalgamates property binding and event binding, allowing seamless data flow between components and templates. Leveraging the ngModel directive keeps input field values in sync with component properties.

[source,html]
----
<input [(ngModel)]="userInput">

== Exploring Advanced Template Features in Angular 20

=== Template Syntax

Angular 20 introduces cutting-edge template features like template literals, amplifying template readability and flexibility. Template literals support multiline strings and embedded expressions, enhancing the expressiveness and maintainability of templates.

[source,typescript]
----
const message = `Hello, ${username}!
Welcome to our platform.`;

== Conclusion

Data binding is pivotal for Angular's reactivity, fostering seamless communication between components and templates. By mastering interpolation, property binding, event binding, and two-way binding, developers can craft dynamic and interactive web applications effortlessly.
